	<h2><a href= "https://www.bobonyc.com/"> Bobos  </a> </h2>
	
	<p> Bobos is a dinner only type restaurant located in New York that serves higher end cuisine. Bobo’s website design with font usage and imagery helps sell that this isn’t just some small cheap restaurant but a high-class eatery. Font used here unlike those of the previous restaurants is harder to read but the font used helps convey the fancier atmosphere. The website is very user friendly and easy to navigate and uses large images to help set the mood of the website. </p>

	<img src = "img/quicksand.jpeg" alt = "Quicksand Website "  height "300px" width = "400px">

	
	<h2><a href= "https://www.quicksand.la/"> Quicksand  </a> </h2>
	
	<p> B Quicksand is a burger join located in Los Angeles , California. Quicksand features a scrolling page that has background still photos that transition very well and does not overlap content or cause any performance issues. The website uses images as a big focal point for their website, they let the food speak for itself. The font of the website is easy to read and fits the theme of the website. While the colors seem weird to me since I do not enjoy the color yellow, they make it work for this website and it brings the theme together. The website is very user friendly and everything can be found quickly with one click. </p>

	<img src = "img/ellingtons.jpeg" alt = "Ellingtons Website "  height "300px" width = "400px">

	
	<h2><a href= "https://www.ellingtons.restaurant/"> Ellingtons  </a> </h2>
	
	<p> Ellignton’s uses the same style as Quicksand, probably due to using the same template, but still finds a way to distinguish itself. Like Quick sand they use the smooth still background scrolling images and same navigation. Where Ellington’s differentiates is that the theme they use for the website with coloring and text usage helps convey the message of “ this is a higher end bar and grill” with fancier text usage and more professional like design. </p>

	<img src = "img/proteinbar.jpeg" alt = "Protein Bar and Kitchen Website "  height "300px" width = "400px">

	
	<h2><a href= "https://www.theproteinbar.com/"> Protein Bar and Kitchen  </a> </h2>
	
	<p> Protein Bar and Kitchens design is a very clean simplistic design that uses imagery that clearly conveys their product. Navigation through the website is very user friendly and uses a UI that conveys comfort and joy with light blues and greens which helps set the tone of what kind of business they are running. The website runs smoothly with no issues with load time or interruption of animation.</p>

	<h2><a href= "https://www.jeffreysgrocery.com/"> Jeffreys Grocery  </a> </h2>
	
	<p> Another clean simplistic design coming in, Jeffreys Grocery located in New York serving as a seafood restaurant that has a website design that fits perfectly. The pictures of the food are clear and don’t look “fake” by using food cooked for customers in the restaurant which helps give the user an idea of what to expect. The website runs smoothly with beautiful looking animation and transitions. The fonts aren’t too fancy but fit the tone of the website and clear to any reader. </p>
