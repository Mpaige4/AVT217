        <p> Hi, my name is Matthew Paige. I am currently a student at George Mason University for Computer Game Design. I’m originally from Denver, Colorado but moved to Virginia in 2010 and have been here since. After graduating high school in the spring of 2017, I enrolled in the fall into GMU. At the time I pursued a degree in Cyber Security Engineering in hopes of landing a job that could pay well and included a job market that was in desperate need. After my first semester I lost interest in the program and contemplated my future. What will I do? Where will I go? I sifted through the GMU major catalog and narrowed it down to only one choice. Game Design. </p>

        <p>Since I could remember, video games had been apart of my life and influencing it in one way or another. It introduced me to incredible stories and allowed me to make new friends that I still play with today! I hadn’t pursued the degree at first because I felt that the market was oversaturated and would be very difficult to break into. I sat back and thought to myself, “Is this something I would genuinely enjoy doing for the rest of my life?” and the answer was yes. My goal moving forward is to help be apart of something that can give someone a genuine experience that they can remember for years to come. </p>
