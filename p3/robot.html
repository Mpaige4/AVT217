              <h1> WW2 Robot Model </h1>

              <p>This robot was one of the very first things that I had the opportunity of learning to model. This was done in GAME 231 at GMU in Greg Grimsbys class. This
              robot mainly consisted of basic geometric shapes such as cylinders, squares, rectangles and so on. The texture of the robot was representative of that
            of a cambells soup can but changing some of the naming for copyright reasoning. When it came to modelling this piece the easiest part came with animating.
          Since the robot is an inorganic character we dont have to worry about weighting of certain bones when working with movement. The biggest pain came from UV'ing the robot
        since the robot was mainly basic shapes, when the parts were basically split up it requried a lot of stitching together. </p>
