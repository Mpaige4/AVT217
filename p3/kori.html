              <h1> Kori </h1>

              <p>Kori was a project that I worked on as level designer and builder during GAME 210 at GMU. The basis of Kori was supposed to be a simple but challenging puzzle 2D platformer game that containted a rich story
              that could be discovered through the use of items found throughout the map.  </p>

              <br>

              <p> On my end the main issue with the game was trying to make it harder. Our first couple of builds of the game, feedback from playtesters came to the conclusion that the game was too easy, so our biggest
              struggle was trying to make it harder but not too hard to where they cant complete it. The image above was the final level that we designed that included false platforms, lever activated events, and hidden doors to try to add complexity to the level. </p>
