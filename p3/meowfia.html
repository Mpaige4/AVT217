              <h1> Mewofia </h1>

            <p> Mewofia was my first project ever working with Unity. The concept of the game was supposed to be a 2d sidescrolling story game where you advanced the story through finding clues throughout the area by interacting with people and objects. </p>
            <br>
            <p> The main issues that came with this project were I simply had never used Unity before and had very little knowledge of C# coding to go along with it.
            Since I didnt know any coding I was basically having to borrow code for almost everything and had to spend hours with the proffessor in office hours
          trying to get the game working the way it was supposed to.  </p>
