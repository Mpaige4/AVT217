<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide.</dfn> 

In <i>sous vide cooking</i>, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. <br>


 In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks </cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i> Sous Vide </i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise </b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30 </time>.</p>
