		<h3> <strong> University Mall Theatres </strong> </h3> 
		<h5> <a href = "https://www.universitymalltheatres.com/"> Uni Mall Website </a> </h5>
	
			<p> Right off the bat you can tell that this websites was made by a student from high school using skills they just learned in their IT class. The first thing when you open the website is not the University Mall theatre logo nor the times, its blinding color whose hues are ramped up to the max and do not complement each other. The next thing you notice, if you managed to still have some vision after being blinded by intense color, would be that every piece of text is in a different font. Once you get passed  the blinding color and off putting text choices and start to navigate the site, you notice that the webpages have no originality to them or variety, the same design is copy pasted to the next, the only difference being the image showing movie times. </p>

		<h3> <strong> Pacific Northwest X-ray Inc. </strong> </h3>
		<h5>  <a href="http://www2.pnwx.com/"> Pacific Northwest X-ray Inc. </a>  </h5>

			<p> 	Unlike University Mall theatres, This website doesn’t use the entire color spectrum for each different text box and design. The website still looks like a high school student designed it with a 30 min video on HTML. If I were stumbling upon this website before hand as a professional I would immediately exit thinking that It was a scam website. The color choices do not contrast well making the text very hard to read and organized poorly.   </p>

		<a href="https://www.hltv.org"> <img src = "img/hltv.png" alt = "HLTV Website" width = "50%"> </a>
		
		
		<h3> <strong> HLTV.ORG </strong> </h3>
		<h5><a href="https://www.hltv.org/"> HLTV.ORG </a>  </h5> </h5>
	
			<p> A good example of a good website design without being too complicated is hltv. Hltv is a website used to track matches and news about popular game CSGO. The website doesn’t have any over the top design wise but has very easily able to use UI and directory. The information is neatly organized into columns with relevant information. Since the website isn’t too complicated it runs at a fast load time for any device. </p>

		<h3> <strong> GFUEL </strong> </h3>
		<h5> <a href="https://gfuel.com"> GFUEL.com </a> </h5>
	
		
	
	
			<p> A good example of good website design that has the fancier designs is gfuel. Gfuel is an energy supplement sold primarily online. The website features smooth pop up menus and is very user friendly with simple navigation to be able to get anywhere you need to without hassle and with a design that is visually appealing. </p>
